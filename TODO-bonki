[ ] add \tools to $PATH (automagically or in config files?)
    (this allows dropping in nircmd without having to add it to system PATH)

applications:
  [-] drag'n'drop order
  [-] how is display order in moonlight done? by some (hidden) ID or in the order it's sent?
      -> neither, seems to be by name in lexical order
         (see also https://ideas.moonlight-stream.org/posts/19/unify-sorting-across-platforms-and-implement-sorting)

log search:
  [x] autoscroll
  [x] case-insensitive search
  [ ] clear button

unpair:
  [ ] show client IDs/fingerprints
  [ ] unpair specific clients (see also https://ideas.moonlight-stream.org/posts/241/managed-paired-clients)

commands:
  [ ] reorder via drag'n'drop
  [ ] "+" creates new after current row
  [ ] temporarily deactivate

applications:
  [ ] image: display which PATH is concatenated for relative paths

GUI:
  [ ] fix vertical middle-alignment
  [ ] add "save and restart" next to "save" button?
  [ ] "configuration" tab adds a "restart" button when changes are made, other tabs don't do this (applications for example)
      if config state changes, display this in the menu bar and add a restart button there
  [ ] make menu header sticky so it won't scroll
  [ ] show logged in username
  [ ] logout option
